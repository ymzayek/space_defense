# Questions

1. **What is the complexity of your algorithm (in big O notation)?**

   I'm not so familiar with big O notation but I think it would be quadratic
   given that it is 2D.

2. **How would you improve your algorithm?**

   I can consider a more efficient way to calculate the distance between pairs.
   The scipy algorithm is better than brute force in small data cases but I
   could research other ways. I also know that there is overlap in terms of
   closest points of support ships to offensive ships so I would also need to
   solve that.

3. **How would your adapt your algorithm to three dimensions? How would that
   affect the complexity?**

   Yes since the space is bigger (NxNxN) vs (NxN) it would affect complexity.
   I would research the most effecient way to calculate a distance matrix in
   3D space.
